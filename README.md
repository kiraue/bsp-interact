# BSP interact (aka bsp api (cpp) for now)
A few c++ header files to help interacting with bsp files

TODO:

-add handling for different versions of bsp files.

-add more "write-ability", ie : as of now, the header files only help with reading and modifying, not making from scratch. make that no longer the case.

-add missing struct definitions.
